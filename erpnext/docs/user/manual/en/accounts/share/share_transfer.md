# Shareholder Transfer

There may be times when you want to change the share structure of your company; either by adding a new shareholder or by changing the existing proportion of shares between shareholders. A share transfer is the process of transferring existing shares from one person to another; either by sale or gift.

You can directly create your Shareholders via

> Accounts > Share Transfer
